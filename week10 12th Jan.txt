Kubernetes (K8s) — One-Page Summary
 What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source container orchestration platform.

Think of it as the operating system of your data center, responsible for:

Deploying containers

Scaling applications

Self-healing (restart, reschedule on failure)

Networking containers

Managing storage

Rolling updates & rollbacks

👉 It provides infrastructure automation, self-healing, and declarative state management.

🔹 Kubernetes Architecture (High Level)

Kubernetes uses a Master–Worker architecture:

🧠 Control Plane (Master)

The brain of the cluster

Decides what should run and where

💪 Data Plane (Worker Nodes)

The muscles

Actually run your applications (pods)

🧠 Control Plane Components
1️⃣ kube-apiserver (Front Door)

Entry point for all kubectl & API requests

Validates requests (authn/authz)

Stores cluster state in etcd

Stateless → can be horizontally scaled

👉 Acts like a receptionist for the cluster.

2️⃣ etcd (Source of Truth)

Distributed key-value store

Stores:

Desired state

Cluster metadata

Pod & node info

Secrets (encrypted)

If etcd is lost → cluster is lost

👉 Backups are critical.

3️⃣ kube-scheduler

Assigns pods to nodes

Decides based on:

CPU & memory

Node health

Taints & tolerations

Affinity / anti-affinity

Pod priority

Chooses the best node for each pod

4️⃣ kube-controller-manager

Runs continuous control loops

Ensures actual state = desired state

Important controllers:

Node controller

Deployment controller

ReplicaSet controller

Job controller

Volume controller

👉 If something breaks, controllers fix it automatically.

5️⃣ cloud-controller-manager (Cloud only)

Integrates Kubernetes with AWS / Azure / GCP

Manages:

Load balancers

Cloud routes

Cloud disks

VM health

💪 Data Plane Components (Worker Nodes)
1️⃣ kubelet (Node Agent)

Runs on every worker node

Talks to API server

Responsibilities:

Start & monitor pods

Restart failed containers

Pull images

Mount volumes

2️⃣ kube-proxy (Networking)

Manages Service → Pod networking

Uses:

iptables or ipvs

Load balances traffic across pods

Enables east–west traffic inside cluster

3️⃣ Container Runtime

Kubernetes uses CRI to run containers.
Common runtimes:

containerd (most common)

CRI-O

Docker (runtime deprecated)

Responsibilities:

Pull images

Run containers

Manage namespaces & cgroups

🔌 Additional Cluster Services
🔹 CNI (Networking)

Gives each pod a unique IP

Handles routing & virtual interfaces

Popular CNIs:

Calico

Cilium

Flannel

AWS VPC CNI

🔹 CSI (Storage)

Manages persistent storage

Supports:

EBS / Azure Disk / GCP PD

NFS, Ceph

Local volumes

Enables dynamic volume provisioning
