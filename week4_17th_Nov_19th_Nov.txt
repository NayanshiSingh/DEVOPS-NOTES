Revision Notes on GitHub Actions and Docker Integration in Java Maven Project
Overview
This guide provides comprehensive notes on setting up and working with GitHub Actions and Docker, specifically in the context of a Java Maven project. It aims to cover key concepts taught in the class, including setting up repositories, configuring CI/CD workflows in GitHub, managing secrets, and integrating Docker.

1. Setting Up a Git Repository
Clone a Repository:

Clone the GitHub repository using Git commands.
Ensure the directory structure is correctly mirrored locally, particularly the src and pom.xml file.
Git Commands:

Use git add, git commit, and git push to manage changes and synchronize with the remote repositor.
When setting up a new repository, remember to create it through the GitHub interface and clone it locally for file operation.
2. Introduction to GitHub Actions
Setting Up Actions:

GitHub Actions allows automation of CI/CD processes directly in your GitHub repository.
Common actions include building Java Maven projects using templates provided by GitHub.
Configuration:

Use YAML files for defining workflows. The workflows can be triggered on specific events like code push or pull reques.
Syntax is crucial in YAML; always prefer to copy-paste to avoid spacing error.
Multi-Job Workflows:

GitHub Actions can handle multiple jobs that run in parallel on different virtual environments like Ubuntu, Windows, or macO.
3. Building and Testing with Maven
Maven Configuration:

Use pom.xml for project configuration, where you can specify dependencies, plugins, and build configuration.
Continuous Integration:

Set up Maven-specific GitHub Actions to automate tasks like compiling, running tests, and building packages.
Use mvn clean package to compile and package the application into a JAR or WAR file, based on configuration.
4. Docker Setup and Integration
Docker Configuration:

Manage Docker-related files alongside your application code, such as the Dockerfil.
Ensure Docker is set up independently of Java to handle containerizatio.
Docker Hub and Secrets Management:

Use Docker Hub for storing and distributing Docker images.
Avoid hardcoding sensitive data like Docker credentials. Instead, use GitHub Secrets to securely store and retrieve them in workflow.
Building and Pushing Docker Images:

Automate image builds using GitHub Actions, ensuring to use the correct tags and credentials for Docker Hu.
Running Tests:

Implement basic tests within Docker containers to verify builds. Advanced tests would require proper coding from developers.
5. Advanced Topics
Security Scans and Compliance:

Perform security scans on code and Docker images using tools like SAST and DAST, integrated with GitHub Actions.
Use Trivy for scanning Docker images and ensure you capture any vulnerabilities.
Linting and Static Analysis:

Employ actions like Checkstyle and CodeQL for linting and static code analysis to maintain code quality and compliance.
Conclusion
This overview provided insights into effectively setting up and managing a Java Maven project using GitHub Actions and Docker. It covered the intricacies of setting up CI/CD workflows, integrating Docker, and employing robust testing and security practices. Use these notes as a reference to automate your software development lifecycle using GitHub's powerful features.
